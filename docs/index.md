# Welcome

Welcome! This documentation provides detailed instructions for operating and further developing RiskLinks Cyber Risk Assessment AI chatbot.

## Introduction
This project is a Multiagent AI Chat Bot designed to conduct cyber risk assessments. The Bot has Realtime voice capabilities by leveraging OpenAI Realtime API, over WebRTC. It is built using a multiagent framework in which each agent is responsible for a particular domain and asking the corresponding questions for that domain to the user. The project is developed using TypeScript and NextJS for the front end with a Python backend.

The following documentation includes instructions on how to add agents, guardrails, handoffs, function calls, and describes the overall structure of the Bot. It is worth noting that such details are covered at a surface level. For more indepth explanation on specific files or code segments, it is recommended that you examine the comments within the project directly, linked below.
