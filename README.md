# Working with MkDocs Material Theme

Before getting started with Material for MkDocs and creating your own documentation I highly suggest that you first review the bellow video for  an introductory tutorial for MkDocs with the Material theme and how to post such publically via github pages using the first link. The sub link under the first link provides all the information in the video as a written guide including installation guidance. The second link is the full documentation for Material theme for MkDocs specifically, where you can learn how to add many of the themes capabilities and features to your own documentation. The third link is for MkDocs general documentation not including the Material Theme. The fourth resource provides guidance for creating markdown syntax. You should mainly focus on the first and second links.

### Getting Started

Ensure you are running python 3.12 and above. Do the following to get started with MkDocs:

Create a new folder and open Visual Studio Code in that folder. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following:
- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/TrayJames/RiskLinkDocs.git`
- Create a new python environment `python -m venv venv`
- Activate python environment `source venv/bin/activate`
- Run `pip install mkdocs-material`
- Run `mkdocs serve`
- Open your website in a browser with `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Keep your site running in the terminal, as you edit the documentation the site will automatically update with your changes. 
Again please refer to the above links for editing the site, pages, VS code setup, and publishing the site to github pages publicly.
